/*
The Dining Philosophers problem is well known in computer science circles.
Five philosophers, numbers from 0 through 4, live in a house where the
table is laid for them; each philosopher has their own place at the table.
Their only difficulty - besides those of philosophy - is that the dish
served is a very difficult kind of spaghetti which has to be eaten with
two forks. There are two forks next to each plate, so that presents no
difficulty. As a consequence, however, this means that no two neighbors
may be eating simultaneously, since there are five philosophers and five forks.
This is a simple implementation of Dijkstra's solution to the "Dining
Philosophers" dilemma.
